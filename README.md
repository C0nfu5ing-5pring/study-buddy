# Study Buddy

Study Buddy is a web app designed to help students learn Biology, Chemistry, and Physics through interactive simulations. Instead of just reading theory, users can visualize concepts, see cause-and-effect, and understand the material step-by-step.

## Features

- Interactive simulations for Biology, Chemistry, and Physics
- Clean and intuitive user interface inspired by Notion
- Responsive design for all devices
- Animations for better user experience
- Easy navigation between subjects and experiments

## Technologies Used

- React.js for frontend UI
- GSAP for animations
- React Router for navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/C0nfu5ing-5pring/study-buddy.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd study-bunny
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Features

- **Interactive Theory Lessons:**  
  Each subject has theory pages broken down into easy chunks with clear explanations, no dense textbook walls of text. Plus, smooth GSAP animations to keep you hooked while learning.

- **Practical Simulations:**  
  Visualise concepts with hands-on simulations. Adjust variables, see cause and effect in real-time, and get a feel for how things work, no boring guesswork.

- **Graphs & Visual Data:**  
  Dynamic graphs illustrate important relationships and formulas. Watch graphs update live based on your inputs to understand trends and patterns better.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Works smoothly on phones (except one experiment), tablets, and desktops. So you can learn anytime, anywhere.

- **Navigation Made Easy:**  
  Intuitive back buttons and clear page layouts make moving through lessons and simulations hassle-free.

- **Subject Variety:**  
  Covers Biology, Chemistry, and Physics with dedicated sections and tailored content for each.

- **Animations & Effects:**  
  Subtle animations help highlight key points and transitions without being distracting.

- **Real-world Examples:**  
  Concepts are always tied to practical examples so you get why they matter beyond just formulas.

## Future Plans

- Add more experiments across all subjects to cover important syllabus topics.
- Improve simulations with more interactive controls and real-time feedback.
- Include quizzes and challenges to test your understanding after each lesson.
- Enhance visuals and animations based on user feedback.
